# Python for Competitive Programming

*Made By Rohit Dasgupta*

## About

### About the Repository

This repository is where I host all the files I use to teach others programming, with a focus on the topics that one would use to compete in 

### About the Lessons

These lessons use Jupyter notebook files to teach programming as interactively as possible. I use Google Colab to write these and you may use Google Colab to run in your browser.

Each lesson or reference has a button to open in Google Colab, click the button and make a copy to begin editing!

Each lesson has practices labeled with solutions. Sometimes I'll include hints, but if you're ever too stuck try looking at the resources above and/or click 'show code' under the solution. You may also run the solution to see the intended way it should work.

### Outside Help:

If you are finding difficulty with any of the lessons explored, I encourage you to seek answers as much as possible outside of the lesson guide. You may find answers by from popular sites:

* StackOverflow: A very popular site that many professional programmers use to ask questions and find answers to common programming problems.
* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python): There are very good python references if you look for them
* [Geeks4Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/): Has many good references for most programming disciplines

The Python documentation website is pretty dense but is a good place to look as well.

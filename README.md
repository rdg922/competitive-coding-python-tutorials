# Python for Competitive Programming

*Made By Rohit Dasgupta*

## About

### About the Repository

This repository is where I host all the files I use to teach others programming

### About the Lessons

These lessons use Jupyter notebook files to teach programming as interactively as possible. I use Google Colab to write these. 

Lessons are broken up into three files:

* Templates: Code for learning, just without the solutions
* Practice: Some sample problems for extra practice. These are just links to practice I think is appropriate for this stage
* Reference: Answers for templates. If you're strapped for time and want a refresher, it also contains all the text

### Outside Help:

If you are finding difficulty with any of the lessons and I have explained it to you, I encourage you to seek answers as much as possible. You may find answers by from popular sites:

* StackOverflow: A very popular site that many professional programmers use to ask questions and find answers to common programming problems.
* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python): There are very good python references if you look for them
* [Geeks4Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/): Has many good references for most programming disciplines



The Python documentation website is pretty dense but is a really place as well

The references are also available alongside the lessons but I recommend against using them as much as possible.

### Using the materials: 

Each lesson or reference has a button to open in Google Colab, click the button and make a copy to begin editing!

For practice files, just click the links to be brought to the problem.

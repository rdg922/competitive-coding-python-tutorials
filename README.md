# Python for Competitive Programming

*Made By Rohit Dasgupta*

## About

### About the Repository

This repository is where I host all the files I use to teach others programming

### About the Lessons

These lessons use Jupyter notebook to teach programming as interactively as possible the first few chapters. While I later encourage experimenting in a regular python environment, I think teaching using Jupyter notebooks makes it more understandable for kids I teach especially.

whether in Jupyter notebooks or in a regular python file, lessons are broken up into three files:

* Templates: Code for learning, just without the solutions
* Practice: Some sample problems for extra practice. These are just links to practice I think is appropriate for this stage
* Reference: Answers for templates. If you're strapped for time and want a refresher, it also contains all the text

### Outside Help:

If you are finding difficulty with any of the lessons and I have explained it to you, I encourage you to seek answers as much as possible. You may find answers by from popular sites:
* StackOverflow: A very popular site that many professional programmers use to ask questions and find answers to common programming problems.
* w3schools: While this site mostly focuses on Web Development, there are very good python references
* Geeks4Geeks: Has many good references for all programming disciplines

The Python documentation website is pretty dense but is a really place as well

The references are also available after the jupter lessons but I recommend against using them as much as possible.

### Using the Lessons:

The easiest way of using these lessons is by downloading or copying these files and opening them or pasting them in either [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for the Jupyter lessons or [Replit](https://colab.research.google.com/) for the later lessons

### Using Jupyter lessons: 

[Link to Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

Click file -> new notebook and paste in the lesson and then mess around

#### Using Replit to run code:

[Link to Replit](https://replit.com/~).

Click Create a new Repl and select python. You can name your file whatever you want as we will use github to organize our code.

Paste the template file you opened earlier and paste it into the code editor. Add your code and click the run button periodically to test your code.

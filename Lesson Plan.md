# Sections

This collection is broken up into three sections: Basics, Advanced Data Structures, and Algorithms. The first chapter must be done first, but the next two can  be done in any order as you see fit. 

## Basics

### Lesson 1: Input / Output, Variables with Strings, Numbers, and Introduction to Booleans
* Output with print()
* Input with input()
* Handling String variables:
	* Adding Strings
* Creating number variables
	* Adding, Subtracting, Multiplying and Dividing
* Adding Strings and Numbers:
	* Converting from string to integers and floats with int() and float()
	* Numbers to strings with str()
* Booleans:
	* Logical Operators - and, or, not
	* Conditional Operators - greater than, equal, less than or equal to, etc...

### Lesson 2: If statements, For loops
* Review Math, Logical, Conditional Operators
  * Teach modulo operator
* Using if statements
	* else and else if statements
* For loops to repeat code:
	* Starting and ending at specific numbers
	* Incrementing by numbers other than one
* Creating lists
* Getting elements
	* Get last element with negative indexes
* Adding to a list with append()
* Iterating through a list with for loops
* List Splicing / Slicing
* Using Strings for everything you can use lists for
* Splitting a string into a list

### Lesson 3: Additional Functions and List applications
* Fizzbuzz Interview Problem
* How to use the Python Documentation
* Math Functions:
  * Maximum and minimums
  * Rounding
* Lists:
  * Sort a list using sorted()
  * Reverse a list using reversed()
  * Get unique items in a list using Sets
  * List Comprehension
  * Nested Lists introduction

### Lesson 4: Functions, Sets and Dictionaries
* Creating your own function:
	* Parameters, return values
* Creating a dictionary'
	* Write and read key / value pairs
	* Iterate through keys / values
